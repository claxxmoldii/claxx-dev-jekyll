#### yey! implemented pseudo routing thingy! ####

default was, when you click on a blog roll entry, the browser takes you to the post on a different page, so the entire index page thingy is gone, map and sexy girls and all. 

what i want is when i click on the blog roll item, the blog post appears on that section only, like the index page is not gone, which can be done easily with vue routing. but i'm not running vue here, so this is a hacky-fix... which i am perfectly fine with!

the work around is make index a part of the includes and layout... desu... eh...

next up, clean _layouts and _includes...

yey! i heart big, firm tits!
